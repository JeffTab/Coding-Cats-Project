How do you feel today?

While simple, this application has a lot of room for growth and refinement. Some ways in which the application can grow are by adding a suggestions function that helps the user to better decide if they want a good movie or a play list to dance in the rain with. We could also expand on our range of emotions so that there is more wiggle room for the user in knowing how to approach whatever they are feeling in that moment. By also expanding the options past memes, music, and social media we can draw in a larger crowd of users that find solace in other things…like books. 

Make your own personal diary with a soundtrack. Have a setting that alerts when you’ve listened to ten or more sad or breakup songs.  The user can choose a function to record and have an oral diary of sorts. There are ways upon ways in which this application can develop and be tailored for each user.  As Dr. Seuss said “Think and wonder, wonder and think.”
